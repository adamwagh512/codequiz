# Code Quiz

## Project Description
This is a Javascript quiz that I built to complete the Unit 4 challenge of the UT Austin coding bootcamp. The purpose of the project was to use all of the skills that we learned during Unit 4. The App is a game that will test your knowledge of the Javascript programing language. Please enjoy!
